        <p>The story</p>

    <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away.This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q>

    <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="villagers">Oh dear, that’s too <em value="bad">bad</em>,</q> and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villagers">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q>

    <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <em value="good">good</em> or <em value="bad">bad</em> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <em attribute="good">good</em> fortune.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
<p><em value="good">Good</em> and <em value="bad">bad</em> are just one perspective. Bananas are <em value="good">good</em> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <em value="good">good</em> for bananas.</p>
    <p>Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
